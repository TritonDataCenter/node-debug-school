# Node.js Debug School

This is a workshop to learn about how to do postmortem debugging of Node.js
applications.

## Prerequisites

You will need an access to a SmartOS instance to run this workshop. The reason
is that SmartOS currently provides the best experience for postmortem
debugging of Node.js applications. Later, you will be able to run this
workshop on other platforms.

## How to start the workshop?

Simply install node-debug-school globally (you will need root access to do that):
```
$ npm install -g node-debug-school
```
and start `node-debug-school`:
```
$ node-debug-school
```

You will be presented with a series of exercises, each containing instructions
on how to complete them.
